# Cook Reduce
Has this ever happened to you? You google for a recipe. You get a ton of answers that look more or less good. When you open any of the links the following happens. There is a gazillion web ads. There is a long story about how the blogger's grandmother had the hiccups and used banana bread to cure herself and so on. Further down the page there might be a recipe that keeps on moving since the ads in the page keeps on changing.

Just clone this library and add more recipes in a reductionist fashion. Never again a long tale about some grandfather's old wisdom tooth when all you want to do is to cook some pancakes on a Sunday morning but can't remember the proportions. Seriously.
