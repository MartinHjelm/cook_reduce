# Cook Reduce
Has this ever happened to you? You google for a recipe. You get a ton of answers that look more or less good. When you open any of the links the following happens. There is a gazillion web ads, there is a long story about how the blogger's grandmother had the hiccups and used banana bread to cure hereself and so on. Further there might be a recipe that keeps on moving since the ads in the page keeps on changing. 

Using Cook Reduce you can avoid all that. Just clone this library and add more recipes in a reductionist fashion. Never again a long tale about some grandfather's old wisdoom tooth when all you want to do is to cook some pancakes but can't remember the proportions. Seriously.
